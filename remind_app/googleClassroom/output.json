Use a program to add notes and rhythms, so that your sounds can be heard. This melody could be a part of your larger composition, but it does not have to be.\n\nChoose a time signature (3/4 or 4/4 or larger, but not 2/4. In compound meter, 9/8 or 12/8 or larger is acceptable, but not 6/8).\nChoose a scale or mode.\nCompose your melody.\nBe creative - Melodies have combinations of steps and skips. Melodies have rhythmic variation. Do not draw 8 whole notes in step-wise motion and call that your melody. Do not use a single note over and over for the majority of the 8 bars. Do not turn in 8 bars of rests. Any attempt to do the least amount of work possible will lead to a lowered score on this assignment.\n\nI recommend that you think of antecedent/consequent, ending the 4th bar with something that does not sound completely resolved, and ending the 8th bar with a full resolution. Examples to refer to include Mary Had a Little Lamb, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, etc.\n\nIf you are new to or uncomfortable with music notation, you can use dotpiano.com to record your melody.\n\nTurn in a sound file and/or score. Ideally, I should be able to see and hear your music.\n\nFollow the link below to see tips for writing a melody. \n\n[If you are in more than one music class that has this same assignment, just do it once.
